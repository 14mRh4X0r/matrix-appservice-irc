Tests:
- Add more tests for more edgey stuff (like the flakey section)
- Add more tests for different configuration options

Flakey:
- Handle being kicked from Matrix rooms
- Handle being disconnected from the IRC network (bot and individual clients)
- Matrix rate limiting (M_LIMIT_EXCEEDED)
- Handle nick clashes (incl. alt nickname support on the bot)

Nice to haves:
- Unit tests

Nick:
Ideally we should be using the display name of the mx user and not the user id.
This means we need to strip bad characters and handle representing long nicks.
Could do something like win95 style LONGNA~1. We should use the irc username
field to set the user id which cant change and is set on irc client login.
