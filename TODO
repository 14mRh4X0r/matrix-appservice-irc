Really need to have for maintenance purposes:
- Logging: files, rotation, consistent format
- Stack traces: Check for .done(), prevent unhandled exceptions.
- Models: Unified User object
- Unit tests

Really need to avoid being flakey as hell:
- Handle being kicked from IRC rooms (node irc supports auto-reconnects)
- Handle being kicked from Matrix rooms
- Handle being disconnected from the IRC network (bot and individual clients)
- IRC Client rate limiting (node irc supports this)
- Matrix rate limiting (M_LIMIT_EXCEEDED)
- Handle nick clashes (incl. alt nickname support on the bot)
- Handle extreme nick lengths, charsets
- Handle extreme message lengths, charsets
- If you have a PM chat with someone then start a new chat with them (PM),
  messages from IRC are sent to both rooms. Should only be the latest one.

Nice to haves:
- Support for images/fallback body text.
- Virtual Matrix user display name support
- Coloured/formatted text
- Bouncer support (connect to X as nick Y for this virtual user. Config file
  only to prevent abuse.)
