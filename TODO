- IRC users initiating PMs with virtual IRC users
- Logging: files, rotation, consistent format
- Stack traces: Check for .done(), prevent unhandled exceptions.
- Models: Unified User object
- Database: MongoDB storage for RoomStore.
- Support for images/fallback body text.
- Tests (integration first; unit later)
- Stand alone service (so people just edit a YAML file, reduce scariness of
  configuring a node app to get the AS to work)
