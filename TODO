Features:
- The AS bot should set a matrix display name (configurable)
- For !commands, if there is only 1 IRC network configured, we should allow it
  to not be specified.
- private rooms should have join_rules and topic set to level:0 so anyone can
  edit them. join_rules so that users can manually set rooms to public/publish
  an alias for them. Required: ability to set room visibility post-create.

Tests:
- Add more tests for more edgey stuff (like the flakey section)
- Add more tests for different configuration options

Flakey:
- Handle being kicked from Matrix rooms
- Handle being disconnected from the IRC network (bot and individual clients)
- Matrix rate limiting (M_LIMIT_EXCEEDED)
- Handle nick clashes (incl. alt nickname support on the bot)
- You can send messages in channels you are not a part of (e.g. Github123),
  we should probably send that from the AS bot rather than pollute the member
  list in this case.

Nice to haves:
- Unit tests

Nick:
Ideally we should be using the display name of the mx user and not the user id.
This means we need to strip bad characters and handle representing long nicks.
Could do something like win95 style LONGNA~1. We should use the irc username
field to set the user id which cant change and is set on irc client login.
