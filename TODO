Really need to have for maintenance purposes:
- Stack traces: Check for .done(), prevent unhandled exceptions.
- Models: Unified User object, Message object, etc.
- Unit tests

Really need to avoid being flakey as hell:
- Handle being kicked from Matrix rooms
- Handle being disconnected from the IRC network (bot and individual clients)
- Matrix rate limiting (M_LIMIT_EXCEEDED)
- Handle nick clashes (incl. alt nickname support on the bot)
- Handle extreme nick lengths, charsets
- Handle extreme message lengths, charsets
- If you have a PM chat with someone then start a new chat with them (PM),
  messages from IRC are sent to both rooms. Should only be the latest one.

Nice to haves:
- Virtual Matrix user display name support
- Bouncer support (When a Matrix user is bridged into IRC, create a 1:1 room
  with Matrix user and AS bot, and say 'if you want to use a proper nick, send
  back /nick TheNick', which then just proxies straight through to NickServ.
  This DOES mean that the pass goes through the HS and through the AS, but this
  is no worse than other IRC security. Since the AS bot created the room, it has
  the power level and should redact the password event after submission. If 
  there is better support which we can proxy through, we should provide it.)
